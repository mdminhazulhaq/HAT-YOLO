# HAT-YOLO
HAT-YOLO is an improved lightweight YOLOv8n model that integrates dual channel–spatial attention, lightweight transformer-based attention, and GELU-enhanced modules for efficient UAV object detection on low-memory devices. Trained on VEDAI and RSOD, it achieves higher mAP and real-time detection speed.
